- Created a dashboard for staff to manage online client number submissions
-	Enabled staff to use the dashboard to create client numbers for in-person applicants
-	Implemented a simple search feature, and
-	Added functionality to edit existing client data.

Alliance continues to expand Forests Client and is working to make it possible to add related clients. This function should be in production in Fall 2025.
