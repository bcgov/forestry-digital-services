SPAR is the [Ministry of Forests’](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=A90244BA9C1B4BC6A63304C413DB75EA) online tree seed registry. It tracks seedlots, orchards, and parent trees, and supports ordering seeds, seedlings, and cones, as well as requesting seed processing, testing, and transfers.

CONSEP is used by the [Tree Seed Centre’s](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=B33FA5CCACF949158DA2DA602A6D9C5F) to manage seed freezer inventory, seed prep recipes, and hardware integration (e.g., scales, printers). It’s essential to B.C.’s tree breeding program.

SPAR 2.0, released in August 2024, focused on A-Class seedlots from seed orchards. Key improvements include:

- Modernized registration screens  
- Intuitive interface and helpful system feedback  
- Data upload and smart save features  
- Upgraded database for better performance  

These updates will save time, improve data quality, and support seedlot management.

Team Evergreen has now turned its attention to transforming CONSEP in three development phases:

1. Seed testing and quality assurance 
2. Inventory management 
3. Cone and seed processing 

The team is currently developing the seed testing component. Detailed designs for inventory management are complete and ready for development. The next design focus will be cone and seed processing. 

More information about SPAR and CONSEP transformation will be available here as it becomes available.
