Team Verso (formerly Team Silva) is transforming the Reporting Silviculture Updates and Land Status Tracking System (RESULTS). The new application is called 'Silva' which is the Latin word for forest, the root of silviculture.

In B.C., timber harvesting rights on Crown land come with the obligation to reforest, supporting sustainable forest management. Silva helps meet these obligations by tracking silviculture activities, land investments, and forest conditions. Its data also informs land use decisions and key initiatives.

RESULTS is being transformed because it:

- Is incompatibility with modern browsers
- Has high maintenance costs
- Relies on manual workarounds
- Employs a difficult user interface
- Generates confusing error messages
- Makes user authorizations cumbersome

To date, the team has rewritten the codebase, which reduced system dependencies and prepared the application for future enhancements.

It has also launched [read-only access to Silva](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=12603F97D7324AE68134D7B372937016). Users can now view forest openings, activities, milestones, attachments and use a dashboard with a map viewer. Tester feedback is helping the teamâ€™s designers and developers refine and improve the interface.

By the end of 2025, the team expects Silva will allow users to create and manage forest openings. This will streamline workflows, simplify record editing, and improve spatial data integration.
