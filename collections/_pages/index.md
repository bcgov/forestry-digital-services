## Forestry Digital Services

The Forestry Digital Services (FDS) program is transforming more than 30 forestry-related applications into user‑focused digital products and services. This work supports the [modernization of forestry policy in British Columbia](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/industry/forestry/competitive-forest-industry), which is needed to address today’s challenges and align with [StrongerBC](https://strongerbc.gov.bc.ca/), the province’s economic recovery plan.

### Mission
1. Build sustainable, modern digital services that support forestry initiatives
2. Improve services using human‑centered approaches
3. Align digital products and services with ministry priorities, and
4. Meet the needs of Indigenous peoples, industry partners, government, and the public

### Objectives
1. Maintain and improve system performance using modular components 
2. Enable faster implementation of policy and regulatory changes through digital tools
3. Provide self‑service access to program data, including large and spatial datasets
4. Support innovation in service delivery and collaboration with Indigenous peoples and stakeholders, and
5. Prepare for the integration of new technologies in the forestry and resource sectors
