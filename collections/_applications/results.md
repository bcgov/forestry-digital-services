Team Silva is modernizing the Reporting Silviculture Updates and Land Status Tracking System (RESULTS), which will be called Silva. (It was chosen because _silva_ means forest in Latin, is the root word of “silviculture”, and is the name of the team developing it.)

In B.C., rights to harvest timber on Crown land are granted through timber tenures. By law, tenure holders must reforest the land when the harvest is complete. The goal is sustainable forest management and associated objectives. 

RESULTS is the application that helps meet these obligations. It's a database of information on silviculture accomplishments and land base investments. This includes harvesting and natural disturbances, stocking standards, planting activities, and tree species. Its data is also used to support land use decisions and key initiatives. 

RESULTS is being modernized because it: 
- Is incompatible with modern browsers 
- Has high maintenance costs 
- Relies on time consuming manual workarounds 
- Employs a challenging user interface (UI) 
- Generates error messages that are hard to understand and challenging to correct, and 
- Makes user authorization cumbersome 

Modernization aims to address these and other issues and create a new application that meets the needs of all users.

Team Silva is currently testing the new opening search feature and the opening homepage, which also includes a map viewer and dashboard. The team will analyze testers' feedback and incorporate their findings into the design.

The team continues to work to launch the first phase of the modernized application in early 2025.
