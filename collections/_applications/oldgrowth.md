The [Old Growth Technical Advisory Panel (TAP)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=3B9ED36FB64B4DFC83528101268B73E5) was created to ensure the best science and data is used to identify at-risk old forest ecosystems for temporary deferral. 

The government had no way to track and manage potential deferral areas. In response, Team Alliance pivoted from its modernization work to develop a solution. It used service design and agile to create the [Old Growth Field Verification Submission Form](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=FA95ADB67F584002993F7DA235FF7179). 

Alliance continues to support the form and has improved it to allow users to amend forms they've already submitted. The team is now working to adapt it to capture road permit information.
