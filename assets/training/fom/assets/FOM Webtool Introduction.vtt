The FOM Webtool will help increase transparency

00:00:02.821 --> 00:00:06.405
around forest operations and build trust with stakeholders.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.170
Bill 21, the Forest and Range Practices Amendment Act,

00:00:11.194 --> 00:00:14.590
requires that licensees outline
their proposed cut blocks and roads

00:00:14.614 --> 00:00:17.152
in a Forest Operations Map (or FOM).

00:00:17.176 --> 00:00:20.472
The FOM must be available for public review and comment

00:00:20.496 --> 00:00:25.234
and is a key part of broader regulatory
changes now coming into force under FRPA.

00:00:25.875 --> 00:00:29.433
The most convenient way for
licensees to engage with the public

00:00:29.457 --> 00:00:35.078
and make their final FOM submission to government
– now required under FRPA – is this FOM webtool.

00:00:35.742 --> 00:00:37.656
Final FOM submissions must include the

00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:39.366
FSP ID,

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.578
the FOM holder and natural resource District names,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.531
spatial data for proposed and final roads or cutblocks

00:00:46.648 --> 00:00:49.070
a copy of the newspaper public notice,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.480
and all comments received by the public and stakeholders.

00:00:54.555 --> 00:00:58.659
Streamlining submission of this final
report to government is just one of the ways

00:00:58.684 --> 00:01:03.078
the FOM webtool helps you build social
license with minimal administrative burden.

00:01:03.711 --> 00:01:07.261

to learn about the FOM webtool

00:01:07.286 --> 00:01:10.304
and the convenience it provides.
