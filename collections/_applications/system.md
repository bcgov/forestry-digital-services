FDS has developed a design system to ensure its modernized applications have a common look and feel, meet government’s branding requirements, and are accessible to all users.

A design system is a collection of guidelines, standards, and reusable components. It serves to ensure a website or application (or a collection of related websites or applications, like FDS) is cohesive and easy to use.

The design system is being used on all the applications FDS is modernizing.

FDS’s system meets the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) double A standard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG2AA-Conformance). This is the international standard for accessible websites and application interfaces.

For more information about the system, see our [Forestry Digital Services - Service Design video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWMhSRMOcz0) video.
