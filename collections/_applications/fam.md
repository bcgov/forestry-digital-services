The Natural Resource Sector (NRS) has relied extensively on WebADE for digital. Team Heartwood is improving secure access to the FDS using Forest Access Management (FAM). 

FAM streamlines and standardizes authorization and integrates with trusted service providers. It empowers business users to define and manage their own groups, roles, and delegations. FAM frees users from legacy systems and enables automation, while also putting control in the hands of forest clients.
