Before publishing your FOM, you must upload spatial data.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.117
Start by locating your FOM using the Search FOM tool.

00:00:13.568 --> 00:00:18.590
Once open, click the Edit FOM Spatial
Submission button at the bottom of the window

00:00:18.614 --> 00:00:20.687
to open the spatial submission box.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.972
Choose the spatial object type from the drop-down list.

00:00:25.996 --> 00:00:31.429
The options are Cut Block, Road
Section, or Wildlife/Tree Retention Area.

00:00:32.946 --> 00:00:37.933
Drag and drop the spatial file into the
upload area or use the browse option.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.335
To upload the file, click upload.

00:00:45.585 --> 00:00:49.316
Once uploaded, you can return
to the “Edit spatial submission” box

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.078
and click the garbage icon to delete spatial data files

00:00:57.063 --> 00:00:59.187
Please note these two important things:

00:00:59.718 --> 00:01:04.453
First, all uploads must be in GeoJSON file format.

00:01:05.184 --> 00:01:09.371
2. You can only upload one file per object type.

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:13.340
For instance, if you wish to submit multiple cut blocks,

00:01:13.364 --> 00:01:16.484
they must all be in the same spatial submission file.
