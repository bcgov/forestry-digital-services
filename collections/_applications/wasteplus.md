[Waste](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=FBCD1E6A4FF241C3A6A457535C858BE1) is the Ministry of Forests' application for assessing logging waste left in harvested areas. Licensees submit waste survey data, which ministry staff use to approve or reject surveys, calculate benchmarks, and issue invoices. The system links to the [Harvest Billing System (HBS)](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=4E1093E8C2D9472EA82B2CB00A6C59FD), [iFORWASTE](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=0D574C58F39447518D6FA187EB205290) and [EforwasteBC](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=B7E16E787355441D8CA5863C902B7992), [the Electronic Submission Framework (ESF)](https://apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/pub/hrc/), and [the Harvest Residue Compiler (HRC)](https://apps.nrs.gov.bc.ca/pub/hrc/).

Team Alliance is transforming Waste because users report it:

- Doesn't have the reporting capabilities they need
- Struggles with legislative changes
- Requires manual workarounds, and
- Is unable to store compiled survey volumes, reducing functionality and slowing processing

Once launched, the transformed application will be called Waste Plus and incorporate Waste, iFORWASTE, EforwasteBC and HRC.

Waste Plus is early in its development. Team Alliance is currently designing a dashboard to allow licensees to log in and view the status of their waste submissions. The dashboard will also have better tools for searching and accessing submission information.

Designs are being shared with users, and feedback is being gathered to ensure the system is easy to use. The goal is to release the first version of Waste Plus in 2026.
