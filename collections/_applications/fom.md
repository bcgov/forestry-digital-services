Team Heartwood created the Forest Operations Map (FOM). FOM enables Forest Stewardship Plan (FSP) holders to show planned cutblocks and road developments. The goal is to improve public engagement on forest practices by opening them to public review and comment. 

FOM is now operational, and the team continues to support and enhance it. 
Visit [the FOM website](https://fom.nrs.gov.bc.ca/public/projects#splash) to find, learn about, and comment on FOMs. 

Watch [How to use BC’s new Forest Operations Map (FOM) webtool for public commenting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FmwlnJsd5P8) to learn how to use the map for commenting.
