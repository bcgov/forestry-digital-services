All licensees must familiarize themselves
with the specific regulatory requirements

00:00:04.567 --> 00:00:08.078
associated with Bill 21 and the Forest Operations Map.

00:00:08.474 --> 00:00:15.204
These requirements include an obligation to provide public
notice of the availability of a FOM for review and comment.

00:00:15.817 --> 00:00:21.212
Licensees are required to publish a notice
regarding the review and comment period in two places:

00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:25.849
once in a local newspaper, and
once on a publicly available website.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:30.685
The FOM webtool can help you comply 
with this requirement in two ways:

00:00:30.894 --> 00:00:35.013
by helping you formally submit evidence of 
the newspaper notice to government,

00:00:35.197 --> 00:00:39.919
and by posting the mandatory online notice 
directly on the platform.

00:00:40.044 --> 00:00:46.290
Note that the review and comment period is 30 days,
and begins on the date specified in your public notices.

00:00:47.556 --> 00:00:53.681
Your notices must include a business address and hours
during which the FOM is available for review and comment.

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.271
The notices must also state the 30-day timeframe for review
and comment, along with the 3-year validity period.

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:07.199
Once you’ve posted notice in a local
newspaper, you can upload it to the FOM webtool

00:01:07.223 --> 00:01:11.765
and create your online public notice
following the steps outlined in this module.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.531
Doing so fulfils your obligation to advertise
the FOM on a publicly-available website.
