Team Alliance is in the process of modernizing the Forests Client Management System (Forests Client), which is the Ministry of Forests’ system for managing its business relationship with B.C.’s forest sector and other natural resource industries.

So far, Alliance has:

- Launched an [online form](https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content?id=E290320237694A9584C0CABC5DE3B9F2) so legal entities and individuals can request a Ministry of Forests client number via the web
- Created a dashboard for staff to use to manage online client number submissions
- Made it possible for staff to use the dashboard to create numbers for in-person applicants, and
- Implemented a simple search.

Alliance is working to add more functionality to Forests Client. This includes the ability to use the dashboard to:

-	View and edit client data, and
-	Add related clients.

These features are scheduled to go live in 2025.
